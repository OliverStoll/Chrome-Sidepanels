# Chrome Panels for everything
Bundle of chrome extensions to do everything in the chrome sidepanel. This is a personal project to make my life easier. Feel free to use it if you want.


# How to install
- Clone the repo
- Install the "Local Explorer" chrome extension (external)
- Install the chrome extensions via [chrome://extensions]() -> Developer mode -> Load unpacked
- Make the AutoHotKey scripts run on startup


# Additional Info
This repository depends on additional installations of autohotkey to handle focus of the sidebar, and in the future a local server to handle file manipulation.
